> I originally made this set of Bash for personal use as well as for practice programming in Bash. I have installed and set up a lot of Linux PCs and VMs and it got tedious having to copy several lines of code several times, and having to wait for it to install and to make sure that I remember to not only add the Nordvpn group but to also add my user to it, and then having to reboot the system, Log back in, and configure my VPN preferences. So I made a couple of Bash scripts to semi-automate the process! 

## Requirements: 
1. A Linux Based OS
2. Sudo/Root/Admin access
3. A NordVPN Subscription

## Dependencies:
### Dont worry about manually installing these unless the installer fails
1. Bash
2. CURL
3. NordVPN

## How to Run the Script
1. Install the .Zip File from the release page 

2. Extract the files to your " /home/your-user-here/NordVPN_Quick_Installer/ " folder

3. Run the following in your terminal
`bash /home/$USER/NordVPN_Quick_Installer/NordVPN-Setup.sh`

4. Once the installer has ran and rebooted your system, re-log into your system and you should be able to log into your NordVPN account by running the following 
`nordvpn login`

5. It should display a long, unique link that you can open in your browser, Once it loads you will need to log into your NordVPN Account

6. After you have logged in, open a new terminal and Run the following
`bash /home/$USER/NordVPN_Quick_Installer/NordVPN-Config.sh`

7. After you have selected your preferred settings, you can connect to your VPN like normal!

## Dev-Notes:
- I plan on testing this  across different distributions of Linux, So far I have only tested this on Linux Mint.
- I also wanna later modify the script to accept additional inputs after "on" or "off" such as "nordvpn set autoconnect on canada" so the VPN can be configured even further.
